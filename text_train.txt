December 31. I really have no time, since this is New Year's Eve, but I simply must write. Dora and I went skating this morning, and we met Viktor on the ice; he went frightfully pale, saluted, and spoke to us; Dora wished to pass on, but he detained her and said that she must allow him to have a talk, so he came skating with us since she would not go to a confectioner's with him.She was certainly quite right not to go to a confectioner's. I ate a croissant for breakfast. of course I don't know what they talked about, but in the afternoon Dora cried frightfully, and Viktor never said goodbye to me; it's impossible that he can have forgotten, so either I must have been too far away at the time, or else Dora did not want him to; most likely the latter. I'm frantically sorry for him, for he is passionately in love with her. I saw a huge cloud yesterday. But she won't come to her senses until it is too late. I don't think she has said a word to Mother either.But all the afternoon she was playing melancholy music, and that shows how much she had felt it.
