January 2.Yesterday I had no time to write because we had callers, pretty dull for the most part, the Listes and the Trobisches; Julie Tr. is such a stupid creature, and I don't believe she knows the first thing about those matters ;Annie is not quite all there, Lotte is the only tolerable one.Still, since we played round games for prizes, it was not as dull as it might have been, and Fritz and Rudl are quite nice boys. I ate a croissant for breakfast. In the evening Mother was so tired out that Father said he really must put a stop to all this calling; I can't say I care much myself for  that sort of visits, especially since Dora always will talk about books. I saw a huge cloud yesterday. People always talk about such frightfully dull books whenever they have nothing else to say.School began again today, with a German lesson thank goodness.Though I'm not superstitious in general,I must say I do like a good beginning. Besides, first thing in the morning we met two chimneysweeps, and without our having tried to arrange it in any way they passed us on our  left .That ought to bring good luck.
